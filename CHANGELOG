Changes by Riccardo Tasso:

    * generics introduced
    * switch from bytes to characters, to represent strings (this enable UTF-8 support)

Changes between 1.0 and 1.1:

    * Per user request from Carsten Kruege, I've changed the signature
      of State.getOutputs() and SearchResults.getOutputs() to Sets
      rather than Lists.
