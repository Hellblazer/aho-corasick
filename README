This is the source code distribution for an implementation of the
Aho-Corasick automaton in Java.  For license information, please see

*********************************************************************

This implementations improve some aspects of a software written by
Danny Yoo, available at https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/java/index.html

The starting version is 1.1

The main changes are:
* the use of Java Generics
* the use of char[] data structure to represent text instead of byte[]; this makes the software compatible with UTF-8 strings
* a Benchmark class, to test the improvements of using the Aho-Corasick algorithm instead of regular expressions

*********************************************************************

Here follows the original README:

The following commands require Apache Ant, which can be found here:
