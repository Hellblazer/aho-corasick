*********************************************************************

This implemenation changes the build system from Ant to Maven

The starting version is 1.2

*********************************************************************

This implementations improve some aspects of a software written by Danny Yoo,
available at https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/java/index.html

The starting version is 1.1

The main changes are:
* the use of Java Generics
* the use of char[] data structure to represent text instead of byte[]; this
  makes the software compatible with UTF-8 strings
* a Benchmark class, to test the improvements of using the Aho-Corasick
  algorithm instead of regular expressions
